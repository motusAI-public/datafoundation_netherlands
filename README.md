# Data foundation the Netherlands
This data foundation repository contains a collection of open and public data for geographical and demographic analysis, specifically for the Netherlands. Its purpose is to provide a solid and readily usable set of foundational data points for projects concerning the Netherlands. The data is presented in CSV format and can be used without the need for a central database. Loading scripts are also provided to load the data directly into a database.  
  

In addition to the CSV data mentioned, some of the data is also represented in the GeoJSON format. This can be found either in a separate .GeoJSON file or embedded within a CSV file.

Having a standard, and updated set of data enables MotusAI to quickly enrich models for customers without the need to acquire this data on a case-by-case basis. We aim to update the public data foundation on a regular basis from our private data foundation. Standard models are able to leverage the data from the data foundation directly, this applies both for the public version as well as the private version of the data foundation. The public data foundation is a subset of the private data foundation which is used internally within MotusAI.

Having a standard set of demographical and geographical data available for use in AI and ML models enables models to be more accurate and relevant. This data can be used to enrich models by providing context and providing a better understanding of the data. Additionally, having a standard set of data enables models to be more easily compared and benchmarked, which is important for evaluating model performance. Overall, having a standard set of data available for use in AI and ML models can lead to better, more accurate and relevant models, which can ultimately lead to better decision-making and outcomes.
